Implement in this order!!!
1. Prepare basic schemas for OS and AWS
 1.1. Create global function setResourceProperties(paFromType, paFromProperties, paToType, paToProperties)
  1.1.1. Function will check value type of ingoing and outgoing property and determine how to fill it ("string", [], dict) - append, direct set...
  1.1.2. Function will skip if parameter not implemented or special
  1.1.3. Kde to zapisat???
  1.1.4. Type special only if it has to be handled by code, if values cen be assigned directly, create another resource type in template
  1.1.5. List has to have value type of value in it
  1.1.6. If something in lower level is special, the entire thing is special and handled in function for resource
2. Design program structura
 2.1. Figure out how generic template is stored and accessed by mods (loaded as variable in main method)
 2.2. Function calls for resources use resource type translation table (again, how is it accessed?)
3. Initial template validation (call boto and openstack)
4. Special function return type evaluation
5. Deploy as API
